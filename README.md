Recently I've been addicted to the New York Times' Spelling Bee game.
For those of you that don't know how it works:
You are given 7 letters, with one of those letters being a special letter.
And you have to try to come up with as many English words as
you can that use those letters, including the special letter, and the
words must be 4 letters or longer.

The solution is implemented by using a Trie Data Structure, and the
word dataset was taken from UMich's jlawler wordlist, and
contains 69,903 words.
