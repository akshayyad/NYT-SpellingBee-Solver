Recently I've been addicted to the New York Times' Spelling Bee game.
For those of you that don't know how it works:
You are given 7 letters,with one of those letters being a special letter.
And you have to try to come up with as many English words as
you can that use those letters, including the speciall letter, and the
words must be 4 letters or longer.
